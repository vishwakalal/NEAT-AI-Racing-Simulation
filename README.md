# NEAT AI Racing Simulation
## Project Demo

## Documentation
This project implements a NEAT-powered AI car simulation using Python and Pygame, where each AI agent learns to drive through a complex race track using neuroevolution. Each car is equipped with radar sensors (simulating raycasting) and a feedforward neural network. Over generations, the NEAT algorithm evolves increasingly competent drivers through crossover, mutation, and speciation. Inspiration for this project came from CheesyAI's and NeuralNine's work on YouTube.
## Requirements
If you are running this program locally, make sure you have the required packages installed:   
`pip install pygame neat-python`
